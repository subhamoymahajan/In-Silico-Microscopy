# In-silico-widefield-microscopy

This open-source software package allows *in-silico* microscopy of molecular simulations such as molecular
dynamics simulations, monte carlo simulations, etc. The current version can perform widefield microscopy 
and approximate forms of confocal, light-sheet, two-photon, and super-resolution microscopy (Cite). 
The programs are developed for GROMACS (.gro) files in mind. Please look at the tutorials for examples.

If you are using these set of programs for your research publications, don't forget to cite (Cite). This software 
package is free to use as long as you comply to the license (GPLv3).


## Manual

### 1. gen_psf.py 

Generates a point spread function file where each line represents the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l^'">,  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m^'">,  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^'">, and PSF intensity.
The PSF intensity is only printed for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m^' \leq l^'">.

#### psf_gandy or psf_gandy_sep
*Usage:* 

```python
import gen_psf
gen_psf.psf_gandy(beta, dl, dm, dn, Pl, Pm, Pn, fs, outname)
gen_psf.psf_gandy(beta, dl, dm, dn, Pl, Pm, Pn, fs, outname, otype, nidx)
```


This PSF is based on  R. O. Gandy, **1954**, Proc. Phys. Soc. B, 67, 825-831. psf_gandy_sep calculates PSF for a fixed  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^'"> coordinate, whereas
psf_gandy calculates PSF for all  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^'"> coordinates.

**arguments**

- beta = maximum half angle as seen from immersion oil <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta=\sin^{-1}(NA/\mu)">, where NA is numerical aperture and  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu"> is the refractive index of of the immersion oil. 
- dl, dm, and dn = are the grid spacing over which PSF is calculated. ( <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta l^', \Delta m^', \Delta n^'"> )
- Pl, Pm, and Pn = are the the dimension of the box over which PSF is calculated (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P_{l^'}, P_{m^'}, P_{n^'}">). PSF is calculated for (-Pl/2 to Pl/2, -Pm/2 to Pm/2, -Pn/2 to Pn/2). However, because PSF 
  by Gandy is radially and axially symmetrical, it is calculated for (0 to Pl/2, 0 to Pl/2, 0 to Pn/2) and Pl = Pm.
- fs = full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) scaling factor; scaling factor of wavenumber (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k=2\pi/\lambda">); scaling factor of "gro" coordinates. (Cite) 
- outname = the output file name
- otype = open the file "outname" to write or append ('w' or 'a')
- nidx = a counter for (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^'">) coordinate. This is an integer int(n/dn).
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PSF(r,n^')=PSF(l^',m^',n^')=I_0 \left\vert \frac{3}{2(1-\cos^{3/2}\beta)} \int_0^\beta e^{ik^'n^'\cos\theta}J_0(k^'r\sin\theta)\sin\theta\cos^{1/2}\theta d\theta \right\vert^2">

where,<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k^'=\frac{2\pi f_s}{\lambda}">, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_0 = 1">.   

**output file**

Creates PSF data file with name **outname**

### 2. gen_mono or gen_mono_c

Usage:
```bash
gen_mono -f structure.gro -p parameter.dat -o imageheader
```
This evaluates the convolution between PSF and particle number density (œÅ), which is evaluated as, 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I(l^',m^')=\sum_{j=1}^N PSF(l^'-l_j,m^'-m_j,n_O-n_j)">

The output file consisted of intensity values for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(l^',m^')"> coordinates. While evaluating <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I">, periodic boundary condition was applied. 
To compare different simulation times, a frame is created which is larger than the molecular simulation box size (over the simulation time). 
The resultant intensity <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I"> box size is scaled with respect to the frame and placed centered in it. The intensity <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I"> was between 0 and 1 (both included). Intensity of -1 was used in 
to represent absence of molecular simulation system (and the frame).
